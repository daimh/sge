Most of this distribution is licensed under the terms of the Sun
Industry Standards Source License; see the file SISSL.  However, code
under other licences is linked with it and some standalone programs
have other licences.  Note that the licences overall require
distributing source with any binary distribution.

If copyright notices are missing from files from the original Sun
distribution, Fritz Ferstl said at
http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-gridengine-devel/2007-June/000021.html
"Yes, you can assume that everything not explicitly licensed is
copyrighted by Sun and is under the SISSL."  See also

It is somewhat unclear what the effect is of the SISSL `Standards'
language.  At the time of writing (January 2011) the reference to the
"Reference Build binaries" from the relevant page on the
gridengine.sunsource.net site (dumped as file "standards" in this
directory) is a broken link to what appears to have been a
(long-obsolete) version 5.3, and an announcement has been made of the
imminent closure of gridengine.sunsource.net.  This version hasn't
been checked against a Sun-released version with the procedure
described in doc/compatibility_test.html, and is probably not
completely compatible with any Sun/Oracle version -- definitely not on
the wire.  Thus, per section 3.1 of the SISSL, in order to use a name
like "Grid Engine" the source must be distributed, since Exhibit B
isn't applicable.  See also the explanation in

Other relevant licences included in this directory are:  GNU General
Public License version 2 (GPL-2) and an exception to it (Classpath),
GNU General Public License (GPL-3), GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL-3), GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL-3), the Berkeley
Software Distribution license (BSD), an adaptation of the FreeBSD
licence (FreeBSD), Apache License, and various specific licences for
several components.  The different files apply to the components
listed below.  See the source files for detailed notices.

The OpenSSL and BerkeleyDB libraries are typically linked
dynamically into SGE components, and it seems customary (e.g. in
Debian, presumably following legal advice) not to list licences for
such dependencies of a program.  Nevertheless, their licence
information is provided to avoid doubt, and for convenience of anyone
distributing binaries statically linked against them.  hwloc is the
same at first sight, but inline definitions included from the header
files may be significant for copyright purposes anyway.

          part of SGE_Helper_Service, parts of DRMAA2 from Gridway

        the "any later version" term]

        [possibly using the "any later version" term] (gridengine core),
