== A DRMAA binding for Ruby

   DRMAA is an interface standard for job submission and control
   to Distributed Resource Manager (DRM) systems such as Condor, 
   PBS/OpenPBS/Torque, Platform LSF, Sun's N1 Grid Engine and 
   others. Please see drmaa.org/wiki for more detailed information 
   about DRMAA itself, available implementations, language bindings 
   etc.

=== Requirements

   The binding requires Ruby/DL module, as available in Ruby 1.8.4,
   and a Distributed Resource Manager with shared DRMAA library
   v0.95 or above. If both are available the binding should work if
     * DRMAA library is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
     * drmaa.rb found by ruby interpreter

=== License 

   The project uses SISSL software license.

=== Sample applications

   Please see example.rb, array.rb, sig.rb, stream_and_trap.rb,
   attributes.rb and threads.rb

=== Feedback

=== Todo
   * complete documentation in drmaa.rb
   * complete DRMAA::JobTemplate setters/getters according
     to DRMAA standard
