## About SGE

Some Grid Engine is a fork of [Son of Grid Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine) at University of Liverpool, with SOME improvement.

We have been using, maintaining this famous software at Michigan Neuroscience Institute, University of Michigan for over a decade. We also test it weekly with the latest version of all major Linux distros. It is stable and good enough for a small HPC cluster. Here share it on GitHub, hoping more peoples can benefit from it.

### Improvements
- Compatible with [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/) with ported glibc rresvport, tested with [Void Linux musl](https://voidlinux.org/) and [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org).
- Support for submitting jobs via SystemD which also allows to enforce memory/cpu limitations via kernel cgroups. Many thanks to [fretn](https://github.com/fretn/sge) and [ondrejv2](https://github.com/ondrejv2/sge)!
- CMake compiling support. This paved the way for easier maintenance in future. It took 38 seconds to compile in parallel and install on an 8-core old machine, while it took 302 seconds with the legacy SGE way, and 377 seconds with makepkg.
- Fixed a permission error introduced since systemd 241 in 2019 during installation, if SGE is installed as non-root on production system
- Compatible with the latest version of openssl
- All C compling warning are fixed on Arch Linux and Void Linux. Most of them were caused by 'smarter' gcc, new SSL, new GLIBC, obsolete function such 'sigignore', depreciated function such as 'readdir\_r', etc.
- Underscore in port service name 'sge\_qmaster/sge\_execd' is changed to hyphen in all C files and shell scripts, saving us from modifying /etc/services each time
- Supports both runit on Void Linux and systemd on other distros
- Version is changed to the commit version of this github repo
- [5 keystrokes to setup a demo cluster on any Linux machine without root privilege](tests/5-keystrokes-to-setup-a-cluster-without-root-privilege/)
- [Automated weekly tests for a lot of Linux distros](tests/)

## Three different installation methods

1) **CMake**, recommended
```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/sge
cmake --build build -j
sudo cmake --install build
```
Please check [the tested environment below](#environmet) in case of any compiling issue.

2) **Legacy SGE installation on modern Linux distributions**
```
make
sudo make install
```
Please check the original source/README.BUILD for detail

3) **Legacy SGE installation on Arch Linux**
```
cp PKGBUILD.in PKGBUILD
makepkg
sudo pacman -U sge-r*.pkg.tar.zst
```

## Quick test on one machine
- step 1, as root.

```
useradd -r -d /opt/sge sge
chown -R sge /opt/sge
cd /opt/sge
yes "" | ./install_qmaster
yes "" | ./install_execd
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
qhost -q #you should be able to see five lines of output
qconf -as $HOSTNAME #add this node as submit host
```

- step 2, as a regular account
```
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
echo hostname | qsub -cwd
watch qstat #check job status
ls STDIN.* #check job output
```

## Installation

All SGE services are running under user **sge** for security reason, as this is production system.

Assuming master node hostname is **master**, and execution nodes hostnames is **node-XX**.
**/etc/hosts** on master and all nodes shoud be like it:
```
10.1.1.1	 master
10.1.1.11	 node-01
10.1.1.12	 node-02
...
10.1.1.1N	 node-0N
```

#### The first - on all nodes as root
```
ping master
ping node-XX
useradd -u <UID> -r -d /opt/sge sge
```
sge UID should be identical on all machines.

#### The second - on master as root

First of all, change option **admin_user** in [bootstrapfile](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman5/bootstrap.html)
```
chown -R sge /opt/sge
cd /opt/sge
yes "" | ./install_qmaster
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
qconf -as master
```
Next commands it's necessary to run for each nodes in cluster:
```
qconf -ah node-01
qconf -ah node-02
...
qconf -ah node-0N
```

#### The third - on all execution nodes as root
```
mkdir -p /opt/sge/default
chown -R sge /opt/sge/default
scp -pr master:/opt/sge/default/common /opt/sge/default/common
cd /opt/sge
yes "" | ./install_execd
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
qhost -q
```

#### The fourth - on master as any non-root user
```
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
echo hostname | qsub -cwd
watch qstat
cat STDIN.*
```
