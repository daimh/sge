.TH QCONF 1 "2012-09-17" "xxRELxx" "xxQS_NAMExx User Commands"
.SH NAME
qconf \- xxQS_NAMExx Queue Configuration
.SH SYNTAX
.B qconf options
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Qconf
allows the system administrator to add, delete, and modify
the current xxQS_NAMExx configuration, including queue management,
host management, complex management and user management.
.I Qconf
also allows you to examine the current queue configuration
for existing queues.
.PP
.I Qconf
allows the use of the backslash, '\\', character at the end of a line to
indicate that the next line is a continuation of the current line.  When
displaying settings, such as the output of one of the 
.BI \-s *
options,
.I qconf
will break up long lines (lines greater than 80 characters) into smaller lines
using backslash line continuation where possible.  Lines will only be broken up
at commas or whitespace.  This feature can be disabled by setting the
SGE_SINGLE_LINE environment variable.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
Unless denoted otherwise, the following options and the corresponding 
operations are available to all users with a valid account.

	\fI<add to object attributes>\fP
.ta 3i
.br
Allows adding specifications to a single
configuration list attribute in multiple instances
of an object with a single command.  Currently
supported object types are queues, hosts, host groups,
parallel environments, resource quota sets, users, projects, calendars,
and checkpointing interface configurations, specified respectively as
.BR queue ,
.BR exechost ,
.BR hostgroup ,
.BR pe ,
.BR resource_quota ,
.BR user ,
.BR project ,
.BR calender ,
.BR userset ,
or
.B ckpt
in \fIobj_spec\fP. 
For the \fIobj_spec\fP 
.B queue
the \fIobj_instance\fP can be a cluster queue name, a queue domain name or a queue
instance name. Find more information concerning different queue names in 
.M sge_types 5 .
Depending on the type of the \fIobj_instance\fP, this adds to the cluster queues
attribute sublist the cluster queue's implicit default configuration value or
the queue domain configuration value or queue instance configuration value.
The queue
.B load_thresholds
parameter is an example of a list attribute. With the \fB\-aattr\fP option,
entries can be added to such lists, while they can
be deleted with \fB\-dattr\fP, modified with \fB\-mattr\fP, and
replaced with \fB\-rattr\fP.
.br
For the \fIobj_spec\fP
.I rqs
the \fIobj_instance\fP is a unique identifier for a specific rule. The identifier
consists of a rule-set name and either the number of the rule in the list,
or the name of the rule, separated by a "/".
.br
The name of the configuration attribute to be enhanced is specified with
.I attr_name
followed by
.I val
as a \fIname\fP=\fIvalue\fP pair. The space-separated list
of object instances (e.g., the list of queues) to
which the changes have to be applied are specified
at the end of the command.
.br
The following restriction applies: For the
.I exechost
object the
.B load_values
attribute cannot be modified
(see
.M host_conf 5 ).
.br
Requires root or manager privileges.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-acal\fP \fIcalendar_name\fP	\fI<add calendar>\fP"
Adds a new calendar definition to the xxQS_NAMExx environment. 
Calendars are used in xxQS_NAMExx for defining availability and 
unavailability schedules of queues. The format of a calendar definition is 
described in
.M calendar_conf 5 .
.sp 1
With the calendar name given in the option argument,
.I qconf
will open a 
temporary file and start up the text editor indicated by the environment 
variable EDITOR (default
.MO vi 1
if EDITOR is not set). After 
entering the calendar definition and closing the editor the new calendar is 
checked and registered with
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8 .

to submit checkpointing jobs (see
.M checkpoint 5
for details on the format 
of a checkpointing environment definition).
.I Qconf
retrieves a default 
checkpointing environment configuration and executes
.MO vi 1
(or $EDITOR if the EDITOR environment variable is set) to allow you to 
customize the checkpointing environment configuration. Upon exit from 
the editor, the checkpointing environment is registered with

For the hosts in the
comma-separated host list.
For each host, an editor ($EDITOR, if defined, or
.MO vi 1 )
is invoked and the configuration for the host
can be entered. The configuration is registered with
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8
after saving the file and quitting the editor.
.br
Requires root or manager privileges.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-ae\fP [\fIhost_template\fP]	\fI<add execution host>\fP"
Adds a host to the list of xxQS_NAMExx execution
hosts. If a queue is configured on a host this host is
automatically added to the xxQS_NAMExx execution host list.
Adding execution hosts explicitly offers the advantage
to be able to specify parameters like load scale values
with the registration of the execution host. However,
these parameters can be modified (from their defaults)
at any later time via
the \fB\-me\fP option described below.
.br
If the \fIhost_template\fP argument is present,
.I qconf
retrieves the configuration of the specified execution
host from
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8
or a generic template otherwise.
The template is then stored in a file and
.I qconf
executes
.MO vi 1
(or the editor indicated by $EDITOR if the EDITOR environment
variable is set) to change the entries in the file.
The format of the execution host
specification is described in
.M host_conf 5 .
When the changes are saved in the editor and the editor is
quit the new execution host is registered with
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8 .
Requires root/manager privileges.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-ah\fP \fIhostname,...\fP	\fI<add administrative host>\fP"
Adds hosts \fIhostname\fP to the xxQS_NAMExx trusted host list (a
host must be in this list to execute administrative xxQS_NAMExx
commands, the sole exception to this being the execution of
.I qconf
on the
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8
node). The default xxQS_NAMExx installation procedures
usually add all designated execution hosts
(see the \fB\-ae\fP option above)
to the xxQS_NAMExx trusted host list automatically.
Requires root or manager privileges.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-ahgrp\fP \fIgroup\fP		\fI<add host group configuration>\fP"
Adds a new host group with the name specified in 
.IR group .

to the list
of RQSs maintained by xxQS_NAMExx. (See
.M xxqs_name_sxx_resource_quota 5
for details on the format of an RQS definition.)
.I Qconf
retrieves a default RQS configuration
and executes
.MO vi 1
(or $EDITOR if the EDITOR environment variable is set) to
allow you to customize the RQS configuration. Upon exit
from the editor, the RQS is registered with
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8 .
Requires root or manager privileges.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-am\fP \fIuser\fP,...	\fI<add managers>\fP"
Adds the indicated users to the xxQS_NAMExx manager list. Requires
